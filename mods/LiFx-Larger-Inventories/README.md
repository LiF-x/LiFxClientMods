Copy all images or just the inventory type you want (Root/Universal/Warehouse) and paste them (Overwrite) in: 
##### \Life is Feudal Your Own\art\images\ folder.

#### Uninstall/Revert Back to Origional Images
If you made backups just copy over the changes images or use Steams "Verify Integrity of Game Files" which will download the origionals back automatically.
